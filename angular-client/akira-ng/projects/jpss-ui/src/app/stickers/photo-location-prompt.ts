/**
 * Asks whether to place the sticker where its photo was taken.
 *
 * Asked rather than applied: the camera's idea of where a photo was taken is
 * usually what the user wants, but not always — a photo *of* somewhere is not
 * always a photo taken there — and silently moving a pin they had already
 * placed would be worse than not offering at all.
 *
 * Its own component so the composer is not also a dialog. Positioned fixed, so
 * it sits over the whole stage rather than being clipped by the bottom sheet
 * the composer lives in on a phone.
