 * re-projects the world in a single step and reloads every tile manager.
 *
 * deck has to be steered because `getDefaultView()` reads `map.getProjection()`,
 * MapLibre answers `'globe'` at every zoom, and deck therefore pins itself to
 * GlobeView even above z12 where the map is already flat — where GlobeView loses
 * precision and marks drift off their coordinates. Handing deck a view under its
 * own MAPLIBRE_VIEW_ID decides it directly, and MapLibre never has to be lied to.
 *
