# with the role passwords. init-db.sh only ever runs against an empty volume, so
# on a restore into an existing cluster the roles would otherwise have to be
# recreated by hand before any per-database dump would even load.
#
# Runs as a sidecar (see the pg-backup service) or standalone:
#   ./backup/pg-backup.sh once   # single backup, then exit
#   ./backup/pg-backup.sh loop   # backup at every local midnight (default)
