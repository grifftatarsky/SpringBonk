Welcome!

Ok.

My plans.

One: Properly seperate out the local code and the fake keycloak so it's clear they're not for prod apps.

Swift:
Add a server-selection in memory functionality. This will make Bonk "applicable to all"
We'll also need a page/section detailing how to set up your own Bonk server.
